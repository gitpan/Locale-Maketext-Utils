Revision history for Perl extension Locale::Maketext::Utils.

0.17  Tue Jun  9 10:24:54 2009
    - $Onesided-ness respect 'use_external_lex_cache'
    - 'add_lex_hash_silent_if_already_added' boolean

0.16  Mon Jun  8 10:08:03 2009
    - move all no()s outside of loops
    - add support for use_external_lex_cache (see Locale::Maketext's https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46738 )
    - change test's BAILOUT to SKIP to avoid false failures
    
0.15  Wed Jun  3 16:01:29 2009
    - Dropped need for Locale::Maketext::Pseudo
    - removed env_ functions (use Locale::Maketext::Pseudo explicitly if you want them)
      - note: exporting was broken so they were always called w/ full NS if they were used, should facilitate fast search/replace resolution of code using it.
              if you used these functions you will need to:
                 a) make sure you $script uses Locale::Maketext::Pseudo
                 b) perl -pi -e 's/Locale::Maketext::Utils::env_/Locale::Maketext::Pseudo::env_/g' $script

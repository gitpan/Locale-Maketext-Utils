=head1 Normalization

Do not use a raw ampersand even in output,chr. If used as text it needs to have a spaces around it.

=head2 Rationale

Since & is a markup character it must be done via output() in order to be safe.

If it is used as a word it should have space around for clarity.

=head1 IF YOU USE THIS FILTER ALSO USE …

… THIS FILTER L<Locale::Maketext::Utils::Phrase::Norm::Markup>.

This is not enforced anywhere since we want to assume the coder knows what they are doing.

=item Prefer [output,amp] over [output,chr,&] or [output,chr,38].

Problem should be self explanatory. The former gets replaced with the latter.

=item Prefer chr(38) over chr(&).

Problem should be self explanatory. The former gets replaced with the latter.

=item Ampersands need done via [output,amp].

Problem should be self explanatory. The former gets replaced with the latter.

=item Ampersand should have one space before and/or after unless it is embedded in an asis().

Problem should be self explanatory. Spaces get added as needed.

=encoding utf-8

=head1 Normalization

Turn markup related characters into bracket notation.

=head2 Rationale

So we detect and modify them.

=head1 IF YOU USE THIS FILTER ALSO USE …

… THIS FILTER L<Locale::Maketext::Utils::Phrase::Norm::Ampersand>.

This is not enforced anywhere since we want to assume the coder knows what they are doing.

=head1 possible violations

=over 4

=item Contains markup related characters

Turns <>'" into appropriate bracket notation.

& is handled in its own driver.

=item consider if, instead of using straight double quotes, using “” is the right thing here (i.e. instead of bracket notation)

This is issued when " is encountered.

=item consider if, instead of using a straight apostrophe, using ‘’ for single quoting and ’ for an apostrophe is the right thing here (i.e. instead of bracket notation)

This is issued when ' is encountered.
